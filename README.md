MovieLens 100k Dataset Analysis

This is my first project testing out some new skills in SQL and python

GOALS:
- My first goal is to analyze movie average ratings and how those ratings change when we factor in a user's average rating to the score they give. 
- Use SQL to find similar users
- Use python with psycopg2 and pandas to find similar users for any given "subject" user
